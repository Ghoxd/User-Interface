First we forked the repo
Then we cloned the repo - git clone URL
Then we made some changes and ran a git status
Then we staged the changes using git add .
Then we committed the changes using  git commit -m “our message”
Then we need to use git push to publish our local commits
Now we should be able to see these changes
You can check the status in between by using git status
You will repeat this process hundreds of thousands of times in your careers so you will get really good at this
